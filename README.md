## Milestone 1 (29th March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.
>
> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).

### Problematic

Democracy is at the heart of Swiss culture, and the country especially prides itself on a direct democratic system that allows its citizens to directly shape policy through referendums and initiatives. Since Switzerland votes so often on so many different subjects, it can be helpful to have all of the data on every federal vote compiled and organised in one place.

Through a series of visualisations, the aim of this project is to show the results of federal votes dating back to 1981.  For each vote, the following questions, amongst others, can be easily answered by looking at our website: How did the Swiss population vote on a particular issue, divided by canton? What were the recommendations of the different political parties? How closely did the population's votes align with the major parties in each canton? What kinds of referendums are the Swiss people most favorable to? 

This project is aimed at anyone who has any interest in Swiss political life. It is interesing to be able to compare referendums to each other, and see by what percentage a certain vote may have past, or if there is a stark "Röstigraben" that can be observed. Even for the people who aren't particularly interested in politics, it is important to know what issues are being voted on and what referendums are being passed in our country, and seeing historical trends may motivate some to go out and vote the next time they receive the famous envelope from the Confederation in their mailbox! 

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work

After each voting Sunday, the RTS usually publishes the vote results as well as a map showing how different parts of the country voted, as well as the yes/no percentages. Even though this is quite helpful on the days following the results coming out, it can be tedious to go back to search for the distribution of votes for those that happened 5, 20, or 40 years ago. Our aim is to have all the information easily accessible in one place. By visiting our website, you know that you will get all your answers on every Swiss federal vote in just a few clicks, all wrapped up in beautiful visualisations!
